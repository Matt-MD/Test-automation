# Automation Testing best practices

Best practices
1. Have Clear Goals
Before jumping into automation, make sure you know exactly what you're trying to achieve. Common goals include:

Reducing manual testing time

Expanding test coverage

Increasing accuracy

Speeding up testing

Supporting continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD)

2. Pick the Right Tests to Automate
Not every test is a good candidate for automation. Prioritise automating tests that:

Are repetitive and take a lot of time

Are crucial to the application, like regression tests

Involve lots of data input

Stay consistent over time

Avoid automating:

Exploratory or one-off tests

Tests that are constantly changing

Simple tests where automation wouldn’t save time

3. Use the Right Tools
The tool you pick should fit your needs. Consider:

Whether it supports your technology stack (web, mobile, desktop, etc.)

Whether it integrates with your CI/CD pipeline

The level of community support and documentation

Flexibility for custom scripts

Cross-platform support, if needed

4. Use the Page Object Model (POM) for UI Testing
POM is a design pattern that separates your test code from the actual user interface. It makes your tests easier to maintain and reuse, especially when the UI changes.

5. Make Tests Independent
Each test should stand on its own, so it can run in any order without relying on other tests. This makes it easier to:

Spot issues

Scale up testing

Debug when something goes wrong

6. Focus on Reliable Tests
Flaky tests can cause frustration. To improve stability:

Handle dynamic content properly (e.g., by using wait mechanisms)

Add retries for tests that fail due to temporary issues

Regularly check and fix flaky tests

7. Manage Test Data Properly
Good test data management is key:

Stick to clean, predefined datasets

Avoid hard-coding data into your tests

Use data-driven testing to cover multiple scenarios

Keep a separate environment for running tests

8. Integrate with CI/CD
Automated tests should be part of your CI/CD pipeline to ensure code changes are constantly tested. This gives developers fast feedback and helps catch bugs early.

9. Version Control Your Test Scripts
Keep your automation code in version control (like Git), so you can:

Track changes

Collaborate easily

Roll back to previous versions if something breaks

10. Keep Tests Maintainable
Treat your test scripts like any other code:

Refactor when needed to keep things clean

Use consistent naming and follow coding standards

Break down large scripts into smaller, reusable parts

Comment where necessary to explain tricky bits

11. Review and Update Regularly
Your tests should evolve with the product. Every so often, go through your automated tests and:

Remove tests that aren’t relevant anymore

Update tests to reflect new features or changes

Add tests to cover gaps

12. Track Test Results
Make sure your automated tests give useful insights by setting up reporting:

Track whether tests pass or fail

Keep an eye on how long they take to run

Flag flaky tests so they can be fixed

13. Manage Dependencies
Don’t let your test results be affected by things outside your control:

Use containers or virtual machines to keep environments consistent

Mock third-party services or networks where possible to avoid disruptions

14. Continuous Learning
Test automation is always evolving, so it’s important to:

Stay updated on new tools and techniques

Share knowledge across the team

Hold regular code reviews to improve practices

Coding Standards and Best Practices for Test Scripts
Here are the top coding standards and best practices to follow to keep test scripts simple and maintainable:

Coding Standards
Meaningful Naming Conventions: Name your test methods, variables, and objects clearly so their purpose is obvious. Avoid using digits in variable names.

Consistent Format and Structure: Stick to a consistent format in your test scripts. Use proper indentation and spacing to keep things readable and organised.

Comments and Documentation: Don’t over-comment on obvious code—it can clutter things up. Use comments to explain more complex logic and ensure your documentation is always up-to-date and clear about what the code is supposed to do.

Restrict the Use of Global Variables: Only use global variables when absolutely necessary, as they can introduce unintended dependencies.

One Identifier for One Purpose: Avoid using the same identifier for multiple purposes to prevent confusion when maintaining the code.

Avoid Deep Nesting: While nesting can help with readability, too much of it can make the code harder to follow and maintain. Keep nesting to a minimum to avoid unnecessary complexity.

Use data-testid for Stability in Automated Tests:
The data-testid attribute is a useful tool for identifying and interacting with DOM elements in automated tests. Unlike class names or IDs that can change due to styling or refactoring, data-testid is stable because it’s specifically added for testing purposes. Here's why it’s beneficial:

Stability: Classes or IDs might be updated for styling or refactoring, but data-testid is for testing only and stays the same, reducing the risk of broken tests.

Clarity: It’s clear to both developers and testers that the attribute is intended for testing, separating concerns between UI and testing logic.

Best Practice: Using data-testid keeps the test logic separate from the actual UI logic, leading to cleaner code and easier test maintenance.

Selector Strategy: Tests can find elements more directly and efficiently using data-testid than relying on complex selectors (e.g., classes or nested elements). This leads to better performance in test execution.

When adding data-testid, developers or testers should decide which elements are key for testing and include the attribute. For example:



html
Copy code

<button data-testid="submit-button">Submit</button>

And in the test case:

javascript
Copy code

const button = screen.getByTestId('submit-button'); expect(button).toBeInTheDocument();

Best Practices
Simple Lines of Code: Keep functions and methods short and focused. A method should only do one thing, and avoid cramming too much into one function.

Use Modularisation: Break your test scripts into smaller, reusable modules. This improves readability and maintainability.

Data-Driven Testing: Separate test data from your scripts. This makes it easier to update test cases without touching the actual script.

Use Version Control: Always track changes to your test scripts in a version control system like Git. This makes collaboration easier and lets you track changes over time.

Get Code Reviewed: Regular peer reviews help ensure your code follows these standards and best practices.

Automate When Possible: Automate repetitive tasks to save time and effort. Focus on automating tests that provide the best return on investment.

Use Error Handling: Implement solid error and exception handling in your test scripts. This makes it easier to diagnose failures and provides meaningful error messages.
